📌 var
- Function scoped
- Can be re-declared
- Can be updated
- Hoisted (initial value = undefined)
- ❌ Avoid using in modern JS

📌 let
- Block scoped ({} inside if/for/etc.)
- Cannot be re-declared (in same scope)
- Can be updated
- Hoisted but in TDZ (Temporal Dead Zone)

📌 const
- Block scoped
- Cannot be re-declared
- ❌ Cannot be updated (for primitive values)
- For objects/arrays → we can change properties/elements
- Hoisted but also in TDZ

🧠 TDZ = Time between declaration and initialization → accessing variable throws ReferenceError

✅ Always prefer: `const` → `let` → ❌ `var`
